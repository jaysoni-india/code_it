This hands on exercise will help you to write code with certain Mathematical operations in Java.

Create file Area.java (right click on IDE folder icon would allow to create files).
Create public class Area with methods:

calculateArea(double radius)

calculateArea(double length, double width)

calculateArea(double height, double length, double width)

These methods would return area of circle, rectangle and cuboid respectively.

Compile this class through command javac Area.java

Create another file Solution1.java. Create public class Solution1 with main method in this file.
Create object of Area class from main method and call first calculateArea method with values:

radius = 14.0 for circle.

Compile Java class through command javac Solution1.java.

Execute main method in Solution1 class through command java Solution1. Output should be 616.0
